# Bobble Sort

This project is entry project for ruby, which has been built to sort arrays with the bubble sort methodology. And it consists of two types of methods, first - sorts the array with ruby method, second - sorts the array with the method which has yield and block.

## Bubble Sort Algorithm: Steps on how it works:
In an unsorted array of elements, start with the first two elements and sort them in ascending order. (Compare the element to check which one is greater).

- Compare the second and third element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Compare the third and fourth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Compare the fourth and fifth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Repeat steps 1‚Äì5 until no more swaps are required.

There's also [an entry on Bubble Sort on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) that's worth taking a look at.
